# End your Lab

  Congrats, you've finished your lab!

  Please proceed to end your lab by clicking on the "..." (three dots) on the top right menu, then **Delete** option.

   <div>

   <blockquote class="error">
      This is a destructive operation, and will delete all resources in your lab. Only Delete your lab when you have performed all of its tasks.
